      About the Binge Watching Collection â€“ Coming out May 2019
    %p.p
      The Binge Watching collection (Abrams Books) takes you on an exploration
      of a city through its most emblematic TV series. Discover the essence of
      New York and London as depicted in the golden age of television.
      The books are organized by chapters focusing on major TV shows,
      neighborhoods and themes, with an introduction about their socio-cultural
      significance.
    %p.p
      The two volumes present guided tours of must-see filming locations and
      personalized recommendations to get acquainted with the lifestyle of your
      favorite characters. With the passion of a fan and the eye of an
      anthropologist, the author accompanies you behind the scenes to deliver
      an informative, entertaining, interactive, and unique visit to a place
      that is so much more than a backdrop.
